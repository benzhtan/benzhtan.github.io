    <h1>Why are we scared of nuclear energy?</h1>

            <p><span class="dropcap">C</span>onfusion swam through Heather Hoff's mind as she sped through the darkness along the winding curves of the private access road that hugged the Pacific coast. To her right were the familiar rolling hills of California dotted with shrubbery. To her left, the inky black expanse of the Pacific Ocean. She had been urgently requested to report back to work before authorities closed access to the coastline stretching from Avila Beach in the south to Sonoma in the north.</p>

            <p>"What's going on?" Hoff asked as she stepped into the briefing room of Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant about 12 miles south-west of San Luis Obispo, California. "Tsunami watch," she was told. She and her fellow relief reactor operators were to go and watch the ocean for a rapidly receding tide, a harbinger of the chaos to come.</p>

            <p>For Hoff, chaos began earlier that evening as she stood at her duty station in the reactor control room. The lone television in the briefing room informed the control room personnel of a large and powerful earthquake on the other side of the Pacific off the coast of Japan. The resulting tsunami washed ashore, flooding everything up to over six miles inland. Standing in the path of the formidable wall of water was Diablo Canyon's sister nuclear power plant: Fukushima-Daiichi.</p>

            <p>"Those are my fellow nuclear operators that were terrified," said Hoff. "They don't know if their families were okay and their coworkers were around the plant. They don't know if people are dead. They don't have any indications of what's going on. It was a nightmare scenario."</p>

            <p>The nightmare was just beginning. As the media coverage of the unfolding calamity intensified, misinformation began to spread. Nuclear industry insiders, like Hoff, had access to more information than the general public did. But that did not prevent rumors from spreading that a burning spent fuel pool indicated that an explosion at Fukushima was imminent.</p>

            <p>"The Chernobyl accident was bad because the core itself exploded and distributed [debris]," Hoff said, explaining why the Soviet government evacuated the nearby city of Pripyat when a reactor exploded at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in April 1986. "So if the fuel pools burned or exploded, that would be kind of a similar situation. I'm terrified. I'm like, 'it's the next Chernobyl and there's three of them.'"</p>

            <p>Ultimately, not only was the rumor proven to be false, it turned out that it was perpetuated by the former Commissioner of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Gregory Jaczko.</p>

            <p>"And (the media) just ran with it," Hoff said.</p>

            <br>

            <p><span class="dropcap">S</span>ince the Fukushima accident, climate change has come to the forefront of the public consciousness. According to the World Meteorological Organization, eight of the warmest in recorded history have occurred since 2015. In 2023, a report published by the United Nations Conference of the Parties suggested that humanity's window to limit global warming to 1.5ÂºC might be closing more rapidly than previously thought. Calls to decarbonize the energy grid have intensified but frequently omit nuclear energy because of decades of negative media coverage that formed negative connotations of nuclear energy in the public consciousness.</p>

            <p>When nuclear energy made its debut in the 1950s, it was heralded as a revolutionary source of electricity that was going to be "too cheap to meter," as the saying went. But nuclear energy's destructive origins were never far from mind. The Three Mile Island accident coincided almost perfectly with the theatrical release of "The China Syndrome," which only reinforced the public perception of the dangers inherent to nuclear energy.</p>

            <p>Hoff, who founded a pro-nuclear advocacy group called Mothers for Nuclear, frequently takes straw polls during speaking engagements to encourage people to share their perception of nuclear energy.</p>

            <p>"We love to do that because it gives people a chance to really kind of air their dirty laundry," Hoff explained. "Like 'shout out all the crazy!' The glowing green goo, the explosions, weapons, waste, three-eyed fish. Every once in a while we get some people that are like, 'clean power!' and we're like, 'yay!' But not always."</p>

            <p>The disconnect between nuclear energy and clean power is reflected in how the news media covers nuclear energy.</p>

            <p><b>[TK expert quote from Silje Kristiansen (interview scheduled for 231123)]</b></p>

            <p>An analysis of articles that appeared in the New York Times from 2010 to 2022 shows the evolution of how the news media reports on nuclear energy. The news media's coverage of nuclear energy can largely be broken down into three sections. Nuclear energy in the context of the "nuclear industrial complex," nuclear energy in the context of the Fukushima disaster, and nuclear energy in the context of climate change.</p>

                        <p>Before Fukushima, nuclear energy was reported largely within the context of the energy industry and economic factors.

Storage issues take on more prominence, with mentions of "interim storage," "permanent repository," and Yucca Mountain.</p>

                        <p>Coverage of nuclear in 2016 occurs in the context of energy and gas, specifically, clean and renewable energy, and natural gas. Wind also features prominently, particularly coverage of onshore wind projects. Despite the positive lean of coverage in 2016, there is some residual disgust from the release of radioactive water from Fukushima-Daiichi. An ice wall was built around the facility to prevent groundwater from flowing through the plant on its way to the ocean.</p>

Although countries like Germany and France have a strong history of souring their electricity from nuclear, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline carrying liquified natural gas from Russia to Germany is aggressively promoted. European governments see this as an important development because cheap Russian natural gas help keep electricity prices low.</p>

        <p>Methodology: Bigrams are two-word constructions. This dataset show all unique bigrams within the corpus that starts with the word ânuclear,â categorizes them according to an emotive categories gleaned from the NRC sentiment lexicon, and computes a composite valence score derived from the valence value of a word determined by the NRC-VAD model multiplied by the occurrence of the word within the corpus. The composite score ranges from zero to one, representing the degree of association with the assigned emotional category. The caveat is that the lexicon-based approach utilized examines words in isolation, which could take on very different meanings depending on their linguistic context.</p>

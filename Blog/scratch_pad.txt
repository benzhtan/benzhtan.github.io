                        A webpage I designed and built for Prof. Dan Zedek&apos;s Design for Storytelling course at Northeastern University School of Journalism. For this project, I visualized rainfall data scrapped from NOAA&apos;s database and interviewed meteorological experts, town officials, and subject matter experts to understand how one rainstorm overwhelmed a town's aging infrastructure.

                        Masters capstone project completed as part of the Media Innovation Studio 2 course under the direction of Professor Dan Zedek. I developed text mining workflows to scrape text data from news outlets to determine how news media coverage of nuclear energy affects its public perception. My analysis of the resulting corpus revealed a lack of emotional resonance, suggesting a balanced emotional approach to nuclear energy. Academic literature and expert sources suggested that this neutrality was a deliberate editorial choice, making news coverage a unsuitable proxy for measuring public sentiment towards nuclear energy.

    So far, I have...
    <ol>
        <li>Written about <a href="" target="_blank">food</a>, the <a href="" target="_blank">climate</a>, and a <a href="" target="_blank">NFL star turned real estate mogul</a> (and met him too!).</li>
        <li><a href="" target="_blank">Scraped news outlets and analyzed their coverage of nuclear energy</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">visualized meteorological data</a>, and <a href="" target="_blank">chosen wrong methods</a> to analyze text data.</li>
        <li>Yapped with nuclear reactor techs, vintners, and luthiers about their craft.</li>
    </ol>

    These days, I...
    <ol>
        <li>Write about carbon markets</li>
        <li>Train science writers</li>
        <li>Herd a team of developers and designers</li>
    </ol>
    Tl;dr, I like asking questions and finding people to answer them.

    I write about <a href="https://www.remineralize.org/author/benjamin-zh-tan/">carbon markets</a>, analyze the effect of <a href="https://mediainnovation.camd.northeastern.edu/2023/masters23/tan/" target="_blank">media sentiment on public perception of nuclear energy</a>, visualize how <a href="https://journalismdesign.camd.northeastern.edu/the-end/tan/" target="_blank">one rainstorm almost broke a dam</a>, and choose <a href="https://www.storybench.org/using-r-and-media-cloud-to-do-sentiment-analysis/" target="_blank">wrong methods when analyzing text data</a>.

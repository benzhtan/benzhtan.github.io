                        Masters capstone project done in Media Innovation Studio 2 under the direction of Professor Dan Zedek. I developed text mining workflows to scrape text data from news outlets to determine how news media coverage of nuclear energy affects its public perception. My analysis of the resulting corpus revealed a lack of emotional resonance, suggesting a balanced emotional approach to nuclear energy. Academic literature and expert sources suggested that this neutrality is deliberate, making news coverage a poor proxy for measuring what the public thinks about nuclear energy.

                        A webpage I designed and built for Prof. Dan Zedek&apos;s Design for Storytelling course at Northeastern University School of Journalism. For this project, I interviewed meteorological experts, town officials, and infrastructure experts in understanding how hydrological infrastructure failed during a 100-year flooding event in Leominster, Massachusetts. Moreover, I scraped NOAA for rainfall data in the area to communicate the magnitude of this flooding event.

I worked with five other classmates to examine the efficacy of ongoing restorative justice initiatives in the United States against the backdrop of similar programs around the world, to determine if it is a viable alternative to the current carceral system employed throughout the country.

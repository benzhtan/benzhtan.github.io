                    <i>While the Massachusetts RISE Program has been successful in providing an alternative to incarceration and 
                    a path to rehabilitation for some, restorative justice has a long way to go before becoming a viable 
                    solution. Resources are limited, skeptics are common and few of those who might be helped by restorative 
                    justice gets a chance to participate.</i>

                For everything from non-violent drug offenses to homicide, the U.S. justice system has one broad tool to address 
                crime: incarceration. The U.S. prison population has thus ballooned exponentially. According to The Sentencing 
                Project, there are 2 million people in U.S. prisons and jails, a 500% increase over the last 40 years. The U.S. 
                accounts for 5% of the global population but more than 20% of the world&apos;s prison population, according to the 
                American Civil Liberties Union.

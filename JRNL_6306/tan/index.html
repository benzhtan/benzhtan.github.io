                    <i>While the Massachusetts RISE Program has been successful in providing an alternative to incarceration and 
                    a path to rehabilitation for some, restorative justice has a long way to go before becoming a viable 
                    solution. Resources are limited, skeptics are common and few of those who might be helped by restorative 
                    justice gets a chance to participate.</i>

                For everything from non-violent drug offenses to homicide, the U.S. justice system has one broad tool to address 
                crime: incarceration. The U.S. prison population has thus ballooned exponentially. According to The Sentencing 
                Project, there are 2 million people in U.S. prisons and jails, a 500% increase over the last 40 years. The U.S. 
                accounts for 5% of the global population but more than 20% of the world&apos;s prison population, according to the 
                American Civil Liberties Union.
            </p>

            <p>
                Perhaps most disturbingly, even victims aren&apos;t satisfied with incarceration as a tool to address crime. 
                According to the <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/vnrp0610.pdf">National Crime Victimization Survey</a>, 52% of all violent victimizations were left unreported 
                to the police between 2006 and 2019. The majority of respondents said they decided not to report the crime 
                either because of a personal matter or because they wanted to deal with it another way.
            </p>

            <p>
                “In the richest nation in the world, with arguably the largest and most expensive criminal justice system in 
                human history, the majority of people who survive violence prefer nothing to everything we have to offer,” 
                wrote Danielle Sered in her book, “Until We Reckon: Violence, Mass Incarceration, and a Road to Repair.” Sered 
                is the founder of Common Justice, a restorative justice program in Brooklyn. “It is an extraordinary fact to 
                absorb, and one that points to a moral crisis that is ours to answer to.”

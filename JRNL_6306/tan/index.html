                    a path to rehabilitation for some, restorative justice has a long way to go before becoming a viable 
                    solution. Resources are limited, skeptics are common and few of those who might be helped by restorative 
                    justice gets a chance to participate.</i>

                For everything from non-violent drug offenses to homicide, the U.S. justice system has one broad tool to address 
                crime: incarceration. The U.S. prison population has thus ballooned exponentially. According to The Sentencing 
                Project, there are 2 million people in U.S. prisons and jails, a 500% increase over the last 40 years. The U.S. 
                accounts for 5% of the global population but more than 20% of the world&apos;s prison population, according to 
                the American Civil Liberties Union.

            <p>
                Perhaps most disturbingly, even victims aren&apos;t satisfied with incarceration as a tool to address crime. 
                According to the <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/vnrp0610.pdf">National Crime Victimization Survey</a>, 
                52% of all violent victimizations were left unreported to the police between 2006 and 2019. The majority of 
                respondents said they decided not to report the crime either because of a personal matter or because they 
                wanted to deal with it another way.

            <blockquote class="quote">
                “In the richest nation in the world, with arguably the largest and most expensive criminal justice system in 
                human history, the majority of people who survive violence prefer nothing to everything we have to offer,” 
                wrote Danielle Sered in her book, “Until We Reckon: Violence, Mass Incarceration, and a Road to Repair.” Sered 
                is the founder of Common Justice, a restorative justice program in Brooklyn. “It is an extraordinary fact to 
                absorb, and one that points to a moral crisis that is ours to answer to.”
            </blockquote>

                “If you think about the way our criminal legal system currently works, there is little to no room within the 
                structure of a court case for the victims,” said Susan Maze-Rothstein, the co-director of the Center for 
                Restorative Justice at Suffolk University. “They are relegated to the role of witness. Arguably, [incarceration] 
                is more retraumatizing because people are left with their harm and their pain.” 
            </p>

                Criminal justice systems are defined by the questions they ask. In the United States, those questions often 
                include, &apos;What laws have been broken?&apos;, &apos;Who did it?&apos; and &apos;What do the offenders 
                deserve?&apos; For advocates like Sered, restorative justice is a way to reckon with and address problems with 
                the criminal justice system. Though there are many variations on restorative justice, what they have in common 
                is a focus on healing for victims and accountability by those who commit crimes, both to reckon with the harms 
                they&apos;ve caused and to take action to remedy the harms done to them that may have contributed to their 
                actions.

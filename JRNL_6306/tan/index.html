                    <i>While the RISE program in the federal district court for Massachusetts has been a successful alternative 
                        to incarceration and a path to rehabilitation for some, restorative justice has a long way to go before 
                        becoming a large-scale solution to the problem of mass incarceration. Resources are limited, skeptics 
                        are common and few get chances to participate. Yet advocates remain hopeful as they confront a criminal 
                        justice system that&apos;s badly broken.</i>

                For everything from non-violent drug offenses to homicide, the U.S. justice system has one broad tool to address 
                crime: incarceration. Thanks in part to the War on Drugs and mandatory minimum sentencing, the U.S. prison 
                population has increased 500% over the past 40 years. According to 
                <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/research/">The Sentencing Project</a>, there are two million people 
                in U.S. prisons and jails. The U.S. accounts for just 5% of the global population but more than 20% of the 
                world&apos;s prison population, according to the 
                <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/mass-incarceration">American Civil Liberties Union</a>. Yet 
                surveys show that the fear of crime continues to increase even as we lock more people up each year.

                Perhaps most disturbingly, even victims aren&apos;t satisfied with incarceration as a tool to address crime. 
                According to the <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/vnrp0610.pdf">National Crime Victimization 
                    Survey</a>, 52% of all violent victimizations were left unreported to the police between 2006 and 2019.

                “In the richest nation in the world, with arguably the largest and most expensive criminal justice system in

                “If you think about the way our criminal legal system currently works, there is little to no room within the 
                structure of a court case for the victims,” said Susan Maze-Rothstein, the co-director of the Center for 
                Restorative Justice at Suffolk University. “They are relegated to the role of witness. Arguably, [incarceration] 
                is more retraumatizing because people are left with their harm and their pain.”

                Criminal justice systems are defined by the questions they ask. In the United States, those questions often 
                include, &lsquo;What laws have been broken?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Who did it?&rsquo; and &lsquo;What do the offenders 
                deserve?&rsquo; For advocates like Sered, restorative justice is a way to reckon with and address problems with 
                the criminal justice system. Though there are many variations on restorative justice, what they have in common 
                is a focus on healing for victims and accountability by those who commit crimes, both to reckon with the harms 
                they&apos;ve caused and to take action to remedy the harms done to them that may have contributed to their 
                actions.
            </p>

            <p>
                “We are in a place right now where our system is very punitive and has very high sentences,” explained Adriaan 
                Laani, the Touroff-Glueck Professor of Law at Harvard University. “That has created an expectation among people 
                that the only way to take harm seriously is to have a very high sentence…. You have to get over this assumption 
                that a restorative process is somehow not taking it seriously. Restorative justice can really get at true 
                accountability in a way that the regular criminal process of incarceration does not.”

                That belief, and some early promising studies on the effectiveness of restorative justice in lowering rates of 
                recidivism, have led to the growth of restorative justice programs across the country, from high schools to 
                prisons.
            </p>

            <p>
                A 2020 analysis by Thalia González, a law professor at the University of California,  San Francisco, found that 
                there are 264 statutes on restorative justice — including laws, court rules, and regulations — spread across 46 
                jurisdictions in the U.S. However, “the vast majority of restorative justice laws are highly localized with 
                significant discretion in decision-making,” González wrote.
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>[TK interactive data viz of RJ programs across the US - make sure to distinguish from TG&apos;s research. 
                    Will include searchable parameters such as state, jurisdiction, organization type, offender age and offense 
                    type.]</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                The fact that these regulations are spread so widely and vary between locations undercuts the effectiveness of 
                restorative justice. “There&apos;s a huge issue of equal access to restorative justice and equity in 
                particular,” Laani said.“One [question] is whether or not all communities should have access to restorative 
                justice. Ideally, you don&apos;t want a kind of discretionary system where it&apos;s just up in the air, but you 
                want to have a very clear criteria for when people are given the option of taking a restorative process either as 
                a form of diversion or as a form of reducing a criminal penalty.”
            </p>

            <p>
                The lack of uniformity increases the likelihood for discrimination during the decision-making process. “Colorado 
                state law allows for police officers to make an ad hoc decision in the field essentially as [whether] to refer 
                youth to restorative justice,” González said. “That's problematic because you can think about coercion, you can 
                think about bias, right. All of the things that exist. And [restorative justice] becomes a co-optation within a 
                state framework that really perpetuates structural discrimination, but with a nicer label to it.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Additionally, restorative justice programs face 
                <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/01/woke-democrat-tiffany-caban-wants-to-make-crime-victims-help-their-attackers/">push back</a>
                 from certain government and law enforcement officials along with logistical challenges. At the moment, programs 
                 are rare and only accessible to a tiny fraction of incarcerated people.
            </p>

            <p>
                González argues that restorative justice can&apos;t fix all the problems of the carceral state. “In the U.S., 
                our attachment to a racial capitalist society has been adherent to incarcerating Black and Brown folks for 
                centuries,” she explains. “This isn't new business. Restorative justice isn't going to solve that.”

                “It is in that building of community, maintaining and sustaining community with these practices that 
                you&apos;re actually creating justice,” said Susan Maze-Rothstein, the co-director of the Center for 
                Restorative Justice at Suffolk University. “So, bringing in restorative justice only when things are going 
                wrong is actually a very shallow way of bringing in these practices.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Thalia González agrees. “[Restorative justice] is just one intervention, and it depends on where the 
                intervention happens. If it's much more upstream like in schools, then I think we have a better chance of 
                addressing mass incarceration in the prison industrial complex.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Modern-day restorative justice practices have their roots in indigenous traditions, including Native American 
                traditions. Through a process which some tribes called “peacemaking,” Native American communities often worked 
                through disputes by focusing on repairing relationships and finding solutions instead of placing blame and 
                dishing out punishment. Some experts believe these values are so strong that they support all facets of 
                community, not just when a crime has been committed.
            </p>

            <p>
                “In the 1950s, restorative justice was only cited in the criminal legal context, and it was only about harm 
                reduction and diversion. That's a pretty narrow slice of opportunity,” González explained. “The diversity and 
                flexibility of what a restorative framework is just so fundamentally different now. And it's part of 
                conversations like reparations and transitional justice. So it's just not that one tiny slice. How are we 
                investing in communities at the front end so that we're diminishing those social legal pathways into mass 
                incarceration, into the prison industrial complex?”
            </p>

            <p>
                The tension between various advocates of restorative justice seems to lie with the importance they place on 
                structural versus person-to-person remedies. That said, they are able to find common ground by agreeing the 
                current system doesn&apos;t work.

                <i>Cara McNamara: "I think the important thing to remember is that if someone commits a very serious crime and 
                    they go through the restorative justice program, they are very likely to still face incarceration. And what 
                    I think is that person is going to be better prepared to handle incarceration. They're better prepared to 
                    go to jail and handle themselves a certain way, to not go to jail angry and not do anything productive while 
                    they're there."</i>

                <i>Note: This is the section we don&apos;t have too much information about yet, but it is primarily going to 
                    be through the data visualization. The idea is we&apos;re going to illustrate several different restorative 
                    justice programs through an interactive map and add information about that. Also, TK quotes from directors 
                    of those programs talking about why their program does/does not work based on how that state&apos;s criminal 
                    justice system operates. For example, we spoke to a source who compared how similar programs in Australia and 
                    Papua New Guinea could work in a way they could not in the U.S. because of the differences in political 
                    structure. We could also pull in RJ programs that aren&apos;t tied to the criminal justice system, but rather 
                    in other contexts like schools, etc.</i>

                    yet.</i>

            <h3>[CONCLUSION: Is restorative justice the future?]</h3>

            <p>
                Restorative justice has grown increasingly widespread over recent decades, but advocates like González 
                recognize that the field still has a long way to go towards having the systemic impact they want to see. For 
                the time being, advocates are grappling with a tension inherent to every social movement: operating within the 
                existing system, while pushing for a new and reimagined future.
            </p>

            <p>
                “There's something that's really important about simultaneously acknowledging that we are in the arc of social 
                work and social justice work, and that there are acute circumstances on the ground,” González said. “I'm an 
                abolitionist, but I also know that tomorrow a young person is going to stand up in court and if they could have 
                a restorative option as opposed to not, I want that option to be available. So it's about a continuum.”
            </p>

            <p>
                “There is no human activity that could not benefit from these practices,” said Maze-Rothstein. But, getting 
                widespread knowledge of and support for restorative justice is still a large roadblock for the movement.
            </p>

            <p>
                Underlying the difficult adaptation of restorative justice practices into the broader criminal justice system 
                is what Pointer calls a “public imagination problem.”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “That is the hurdle [that] we need to get over in terms of just expanding what that word justice can mean for 
                people. So can justice mean understanding impact and repairing harm? Can justice mean transforming the structural 
                and equity characteristics that led to the need that fueled the behavior that caused harm in the first place?” 
                said Pointer. “Once we're past that hurdle, once that public imagination is expanded, then I think we would be 
                able to do something like what New Zealand, for example, has done, where restorative justice is a default 
                option.”
            </p>

            <p>
                When Pointer introduces people to restorative justice, they can be quick to dismiss it as a utopian idea. “I get 
                that,” Pointer said. “But I just try to help people see [the] common human need, [the] common human experience in 
                the wake of crime. And then it's less utopian, it's less idealistic about people and it's more just actually 
                responsive to the needs [of the harmed party].” Expanding that public imagination is a slow process, advocates 
                say. But, the growth of restorative justice in recent years has demonstrated it as a possibility, one advocates 
                are pushing for everyday.

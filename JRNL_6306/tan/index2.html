                <p><i>For some, the Massachusetts R.I.S.E Program has been a successful alternative to imprisonment and a path to rehabilitation. But advocates recognize that restorative justice still has a long way to go before becoming a large-scale solution to the problem of mass incarceration in the United States. Resources are limited, data is sparse and few get chances to participate. Yet, many remain hopeful as they continue to confront a criminal justice system that is badly broken.</i></p>

            Thalia González is a self-proclaimed abolitionist. But she also thinks there&apos;s a place for restorative justice.
            <br>
            “There&apos;s something that&apos;s really important about simultaneously acknowledging that we are in the arc of social work and social justice work and that there are acute circumstances on the ground,” said González, a law professor at the University of California, San Francisco. “I&apos;m an abolitionist, but I also know that tomorrow a young person is going to stand up in court. If they could have a restorative option as opposed to not, I want that option to be available.” Gonz cut 1
            González is a leading expert on restorative justice, first discovering the field as a law student at Northwestern University. During her college years, she worked as a circle practitioner at Audy Home, a juvenile detention facility in Chicago. Since then, she has conducted extensive research on the opportunities and limitations of restorative justice, both domestically and abroad. 
            While advocates like González openly recognize the flaws of restorative justice, they also continue to highlight how it could be an important solution to the prison-industrial complex in this country. From non-violent drug offenses to homicides, the U.S. justice system primarily has one broad tool to address crime: incarceration.

            <p>Even victims of crime aren&apos;t satisfied with incarceration as a tool to address the harms done to them. Between 2006 and 2019, according to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 52% of all violent victimizations were left unreported to the police.
            “If you think about the way our criminal legal system currently works, there is little to no room within the structure of a court case for the victims,” said Susan Maze-Rothstein, the co-director of the Center for Restorative Justice at Suffolk University. “They are relegated to the role of witness. And so, arguably, what we are doing currently is more retraumatizing because people are left with their harm and their pain."</p>

            <h3><b>The shaky growth of restorative justice</b></h3>

            <p>The need for alternative responses to criminal actions, along with promising studies on the effectiveness of restorative justice in lowering recidivism rates, has led to increased federal funding and a growth of restorative justice programs across the country in settings such as schools and prisons.</p>

            <p>Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it would award almost $57 million to support criminal justice reform programs and advance racial equity within the criminal justice system. From that budget, $8 million specifically went toward promoting restorative justice programs among other similar causes. Through the years, there have also been several gatherings of experts in this growing field, such as the biennial National Conference on Restorative Justice by The National Association of Community and Restorative Justice.
            Still, one of the biggest concerns several advocates have is the lack of a national framework on what qualifies as restorative justice or how it should be used.
            “We don&apos;t even have a comprehensive map of how many prosecutors and officers are using restorative justice,” said González. “So, it&apos;s hard to know what you know when you don&apos;t know what the hell&apos;s going on.”
            In 2020, González identified and analyzed 264 statutes on restorative justice — including laws, court rules and regulations — spread across 46 jurisdictions in the U.S.</p>

            <h3><b>A shift toward accountability and healing</b></h3>

            <p>
            Advocates argue that restorative justice programs center healing for victims and accountability for offenders. This approach allows offenders to face the harm they caused and take action towards repairing it in a way the current system cannot.
            </p>

            <p>
            “We are in a place right now where our system is very punitive and has very high sentences,” said Adriaan Laani, the Touroff-Glueck Professor of Law at Harvard University. “That has created an expectation among people that the only way to take harm seriously is to have a very high sentence …. You have to get over this assumption that people have that a restorative process is somehow not taking it seriously. Restorative justice can really get at true accountability in a way that the regular criminal process of incarceration does not.” Audio Cut File

            For example, Circles of Support and Accountability (CoSA) programs have been used to reintegrate high-risk offenders in Vermont for the past 20 years. Studies show offenders who participated in CoSA programs were less likely to recidivate, drawing attention to the benefit of using restorative practices as high-risk offenders return to their communities.

            <h3><b>Despite successes, growing pains persist</b></h3>

            <blockquote>
            “There&apos;s a huge issue of equal access to restorative justice and equity in particular,” said Laani. “One [question] is whether or not all communities should have access to restorative justice. Ideally, you don&apos;t want a kind of discretionary system where it&apos;s just up in the air, but you want to have a very clear criteria for when people are given the option of taking a restorative process either as a form of diversion or as a form of reducing a criminal penalty.” Lanni video cut 2
            </blockquote>

            <p>
            That discretionary system creates room for bias around an offender&apos;s race, gender, crime type, and criminal history, according to Lindsey Pointer, an Assistant Professor at Vermont Law and Graduate School and the Principal Investigator of the National Center on Restorative Justice. 
            </p>

            <p>
            “It&apos;s . . . the biggest issue that we have to face right now in the restorative justice field,” Pointer said. “We have something that&apos;s shown a lot of promise in terms of reforming the system, but we run a significant risk if we have these referral structures that could be replicating the same bias that we see elsewhere. We could end up actually exacerbating the differences in outcomes for people if we&apos;re only having young white people from affluent backgrounds being referred, for example.” lin cut 1

            <p>
            This lack of uniformity across states increases the likelihood for discrimination during the decision-making process and is one of the biggest barriers to widespread restorative justice. But restorative justice programs also face pushback from various government and law enforcement officials and struggle to deal with several logistical challenges. At the moment, these programs are rare and only accessible to a fraction of offenders. González also stressed that restorative justice alone can&apos;t fix all the problems of the carceral state.
            </p>

            <p>
            “In the U.S., our attachment to a racial capitalist society has been adherent to incarcerating Black and Brown folks for centuries,” said González. “This isn&apos;t new business. Restorative justice isn&apos;t going to solve that.”
            </p>

            <h3><b>
            Beyond the criminal justice system
            </b></h3>

            <p>
            Howard Zehr, an early practitioner and pioneering advocate of restorative justice, said when he began his work in the late 1970s, restorative justice addressed problems in the criminal legal system. As the movement has grown, however, Zehr said that RJ programs have been applied in several contexts outside the legal system—from the Smithsonian Museum of American History to South Africa&apos;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission and even American schools. 
            </p>

            <p>
            And in considering the existing imperfections of restorative justice, many advocates see more promise in implementing efforts upstream of incarceration, before a serious crime has been committed.
            </p>

            <p>
            “It is in that building of community, maintaining and sustaining community with these practices that you&apos;re actually creating justice,” said Maze-Rothstein. “So, bringing in restorative justice only when things are going wrong is actually a very shallow way of bringing in these practices.”
            </p>

            <p>
            González agreed. “[Restorative justice] is just one intervention and it depends on where the intervention happens. If it&apos;s much more upstream like in schools, then I think we have a better chance of addressing mass incarceration in the prison industrial complex.”
            </p>

            <p>
            Restorative justice was not originally linked to crime. Modern-day restorative justice practices have their roots in indigenous systems, including Māori and Navajo traditions. Through a process which some tribes called “peacemaking,” Native American communities often worked through disputes by focusing on repairing relationships and finding solutions instead of placing blame and dishing punishment. Consequently, many experts believe these values are so strong that they support all facets of community, not just when a crime has been committed. 
            </p>

            <p>
            As Maze-Rothstein said, “There is no human activity that could not benefit from these practices.”
            </p>

            <h3><b>
            Barriers to adaptation exist, but advocates in the U.S. remain optimistic
            </b></h3>

            <p>
            But getting widespread support for restorative justice is still elusive. Underlying its difficult adaptation into the broader criminal justice system is what Pointer calls a “public imagination problem.”
            </p>

            <p>
            “That is the hurdle [that] we need to get over in terms of just expanding what that word justice can mean for people,” said Pointer. “So, can justice mean understanding impact and repairing harm? Can justice mean transforming the structural and equity characteristics that led to the need that fueled the behavior that caused harm in the first place? Once we&apos;re past that hurdle, once that public imagination is expanded, then I think we would be able to do something like what New Zealand, for example, has done, where restorative justice is a default option.” 
            </p>

            <p>
            New Zealand has one of the most comprehensive national restorative justice systems in the world, according to Zehr. But, even the current framework there does not fully incorporate RJ into the justice system. Outlining what a national restorative justice system could look like is a barrier for the movement, Zehr said.
            </p>

            <p>
            When Pointer introduces people to restorative justice, they can be quick to dismiss it as a utopian idea. “I get that,” Pointer said. “But I just try to help people see [the] common human need, [the] common human experience in the wake of crime. And then it&apos;s less utopian, it&apos;s less idealistic about people and it&apos;s more just actually responsive to the needs [of the harmed party].”  
            </p>

            <p>
            Expanding that public imagination is a slow process, advocates say. But, the growth of restorative justice in recent years demonstrates it as a possibility, one advocates are pushing for everyday.

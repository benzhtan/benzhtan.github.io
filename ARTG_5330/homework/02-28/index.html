        <h1>Predicting National Park Visitation Rates</h1>
        <h3>Is the popularity of a given national park correlated with its proxmity to the nearest MSR?</h3>
        <br>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The history of national parks in the United States dates back to 1872, when Yellowstone National Park was 
            established as the first national park in the world. This was followed by the creation of several other 
            national parks, such as Yosemite, Sequoia, and Mount Rainier, in the early 1900s. The National Park Service 
            was established in 1916 to manage and protect the growing number of parks. Over time, more parks were added 
            to the system, including the Grand Canyon, Acadia, and Zion, among others. Today, there are over 400 national 
            parks and monuments in the United States.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most popular national parks in the US today include Great Smoky Mountains National 
            Park (which straddles North Carolina and Tennessee), Yellowstone National Park (which stretches across Wyoming, 
            Montana, and Idaho), and Zion National Park (in southern Utah). Other highly visited parks include Rocky Mountain 
            National Park (in Colorado), Grand Canyon National Park (in Arizona), and Yosemite National Park (in California).
        </p>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
            My goal for this project is to examine whether there exists a correlation between the distance of national parks 
            and metropolitan statistical areas. According to the Census Bureau, an MSA is defined as one or more counties that 
            contain a city of 50,000 or more inhabitants, or contain a Census Bureau-defined urbanized area (UA) and have a 
            total population of at least 100,000.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Main Visualization</h3>

        <p>
            The main visualization I hope to build will be a bivariate choropleth map that explores the relationship between 
            the visitation rates at national parks and the distance to the nearest MSA.
        </p>

        <p>
            These are two maps containing geospatial information that I need for this project. The first map shows the 
            distribution of metropolitan statistical areas and the second map shows the location of national parks. I will need 
            to obtain shapefiles of both and overlay them. A potential issue that has yet to be resolved is one of quantifying 
            the distance between the parks and their nearest MSAs. A good proxy for this would be to measure the distance between 
            the main ranger station and the nearest Primary Airport (an aiport that has more than 10,000 passenger boardings 
            annually, according to the FAA). I will finalize this metric at a later date.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            This is a map created by the New York Times' Graphics team showing distance from the nearest abortion clinic in 
            the post-Roe era. I particularly like this map as it clearly shows distance. I would like to build something like 
            this in this project. However, the drawback of a map like this is that it only allows for one variable: distance 
            from a point. To show correlation, I will need to use a bivariate choropleth map, which poses other challenges.
        </p>

        <h3>Secondary Visualizations</h3>
        <p>
            Aside from the choropleth map, I aim to include drop-down list of national parks to allow users to explore the 
            visitation rates of individual parks.

        <h3>Closing thoughts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I remain unconvinced that a bivariate choropleth is the best way visualize the correlation between popularity 
                and distance.</li>
            <li>I think I will need several different kinds of charts to convey my findings and utilize scrollytelling to 
                create a guided narrative.</li>
            <li>Another thought is to pivot to a "choose your own adventure" interactive. Though, I would need to create an 
                entirely different set of assets.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Questions and feedback</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you were planning a trip to a national park, what would you like to know?</li>
            <li>Are there any non-cartographic visualization techniques that would better represent correlation?</li>
        </ul>

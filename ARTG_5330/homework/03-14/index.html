        Assignment:
        Create a numbered list of implementations remaining in order to complete your final project.
        Your list of implementations should be numbered and ordered from most important to least important implementations.
        Write down everything you'd like your final project to have.
        Implement the first of these tasks you wrote in your list.

        <h1>Final Project Updates</h1>
        <h2>Week 9: Listing implementations needed to complete the final project</h2>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The past week was spent refining the overall goals of the final project. This includes, but is not limited to, 
            expanding the dataset collected from the NPS website, refining the narrative structure, and defining the 
            visualization strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main hypothesis of this project remains unchanged, that is questioning the existence of a correlation between 
            a national park&apos;s popularity, measured by its visitation rates, and the distance to the nearest metropolitan 
            statistical area (MSA), as measured by the distance to the closest primary airport.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Metropolitan statistical area: One or more counties that contain a city of 50,000 or more inhabitants, or contain 
                a Census Bureau-defined urbanized area (UA) and have a total population of at least 100,000. (Census Bureau)</li>
            <li>Primary airport: An aiport that has more than 10,000 passenger boardings annually. (FAA)</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Will overcrowding at America's national parks remove the "wild" from "wilderness"?</h3>

                <p>The Covid-19 pandemic brought a surge of visitors to national parks across the country. People, tired of being confined to their homes during the lock-down of spring 2020, sought the wide open spaces of America&rsquo;s wilderness to get away from the reality of the pandemic, only to find themselves facing booked out campsites, a crashed online reservation system, and when they did get to the parks, overstretched amenities, and burnt out park rangers.</p>

                <p>The news media has been awash with stories about visitors directing pent-up rage against rangers, ignorant people antagonizing wildlife, and an increasing number of inexperienced hikers requiring rescue from trails. But has it always been this way?</p>

                <div class="copy" id="history">
                    <p>Contrary to anecdotal evidence of unprecedented visitation rates, 2020 saw the fewest visitors across the board since 1985. There are caveats to this general rule. For example, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park straddles the Tennessee-North Carolina border. In 2020, it received 12 million visitors. While slightly down from the 12.5 million visitors in 2019, it consistently remains the single most visited park in the U.S. since 1979.</p>

                    <p>A contributing factor to Great Smoky Mountains&rsquo; popularity is the lack of entrance fees, unlike other parks that charge around $30 for a one-day vehicle pass.</p>

                    <p>Other popular parks include Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain, and Yosemite National Parks.</p>

                    <p>Aside from entrance fees, accessibility is the single most important determinant of a national park&rsquo;s popularity.</p>

                    <p>Accessibility can be further broken down into two subcategories: a park&rsquo;s proximity to a major city, and the accessibility of attractions within individual parks.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="graphic" id="bubble-map">
                    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13589728"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                </div>

                <div class="copy" id="geography-2">
                    <p>At first glance, it appears that proximity between major cities and national parks is a determining factor in their popularity. Great Smoky Mountain National Park is situated close to three major metropolitan regions: Louisville, Nashville, and Charlotte. In the Pacific Northwest, Seattle lies between Olympic and Mount Rainier National Parks. Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia National Parks neighbor Fresno in California.</p>

                    <p>While proximity to a major city &ndash; defined in this instance as a city with a population of five hundred thousand people or more &ndash; is a factor, it is not an ironclad rule. Glacier National Park in Montana and Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming are not anywhere near a major city, and yet, they attract between two and three hundred thousand visitors a year.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter_header">Section 3: Usage trends</h3>

            <section id="usage_trends">
                <div class="copy" id="use">
                    <p>The key determinant of a park&rsquo;s popularity lies in the accessibility of its main attraction. Parks gain popularity when attractions can easily be accessed. Yosemite National Park, for example, has a shuttle bus system that circulates around Yosemite Valley, a central location, from which visitors can venture deeper into the wilderness. Similar shuttle services have been <a href=&rdquo;https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/27/america-national-parks-birthday-centenary-public-transit&rdquo;>implemented</a> in Denali and Zion, in part to restrict the number of vehicles and reduce traffic congestion within the park.</p>

                    <p>While shuttles serve to increase accessibility of America&rsquo;s natural beauty, it raises the question: when does the wilderness cease to be wild?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="graphic" id="useage">
                    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13590633"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                </div>

                <div class="copy" id="use-2">
                    <p>Going backcountry camping is one of the best ways to experience America&rsquo;s wilderness. Indeed, some of the least popular parks are the least accessible.</p>

                    <p>Take Gates of the Arctic National Park in Alaska, for example. It is famous for being the least <a href=&rdquo;https://www.nps.gov/gaar/planyourvisit/directions.htm#:~:text=Gates%20of%20the%20Arctic%20is,or%20hike%20into%20the%20park.&rdquo;>accessible</a> park in the National Park System. There are no roads. Visitors must fly into one of a handful of gateway communities, before hiking into the park. Within the park, there are no hiking trails. Hikers who visit this park must be comfortable with surviving in the backcountry.</p>

                    <p>Solving the overcrowding issue in America&rsquo;s national parks isn&rsquo;t about implementing shuttle services at every park. It isn&rsquo;t about building more parking lots, campsites, or log cabins.</p>

                    <p>It&rsquo;s about teaching the adventuring public the skills they need to survive without the creature comforts offered by the frontcountry, then encouraging them to go and explore. Because America&rsquo;s national parks have so much more to offer than what can be seen a quarter-mile from a parking lot.</p>

        <p>Runway incursion figures from 2023 seem to reinforce the idea that air travel has been getting less safe. According to <a href=”https://www.cbsnews.com/news/runway-incursions-near-misses-airport-runways-whats-happening/#”>CBS</a>, there have been 571 runway incursion incidents in 2023 to date, from 1,732 in 2022.</p>

        <p>While it may be tempting to attribute the increased frequency of runway incursions to the lack of flying hours brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, the reality is that runway incursions occurred less frequently in the years following the pandemic than before, pointing to traffic numbers as the top determinant, as suggested by a <a href=”https://tc.canada.ca/sites/default/files/migrated/tp13795e.pdf”>report</a> by Transport Canada.</p>

        <p>Moreover, <a href=”https://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/main.asp”>FAA data</a> suggests that certain airports are more susceptible to runway incursions than other airports. An analysis of the 28 busiest airports in the U.S. revealed that Honolulu, Boston, and Chicago’s Midway airports consistently had the highest rates of runway incursions, while Orlando, Denver, and Washington D.C.’s Dulles airports saw the lowest rates across the country of any major air transportation hub.</p>

        <p>The difference in runway incursion rates can be explained by the layout of the runways and taxiways.</p>

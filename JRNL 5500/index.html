                        <p>Most of the time when I teach HTML to a group of students, they make webpages about something they 
                            are interested in - a band, recipe, place or something like that. People always have something to 
                            say, and love saying it to the public online.

                        <p>Invariably (in the US at least) <i>someone</i> in the group picks their dog, or dogs in general. 
                            People find common ground with learning partners around animals and pets, and it intenet offers a 
                            plethora of pictures of dogs, and puppies, to include in a webpage project.

                        <p>No offense of could to cats and kittens, but in my experience people more often want to showcase 
                            their dogs in my classes than cats. I don't what that says about cat vs. dog owners, but that's 
                            been my observation.

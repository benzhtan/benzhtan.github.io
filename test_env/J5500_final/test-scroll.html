                                <p>Runway incursion figures from 2023 seem to reinforce the idea that air travel has been getting less safe. According to <a href=”https://www.cbsnews.com/news/runway-incursions-near-misses-airport-runways-whats-happening/#”>CBS</a>, there have been 571 runway incursion incidents in 2023 to date, from 1,732 in 2022.</p>

                                <p>While it may be tempting to attribute the increased frequency of runway incursions to the lack of flying hours brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, the reality is that runway incursions occurred less frequently in the years following the pandemic than before, pointing to traffic numbers as the top determinant, as suggested by a <a href=”https://tc.canada.ca/sites/default/files/migrated/tp13795e.pdf”>report</a> by Transport Canada.</p>

An analysis of the 28 busiest airports in the U.S. revealed that Honolulu, Boston, and Chicago’s Midway airports consistently had the highest rates of runway incursions, while Orlando, Denver, and Washington D.C.’s Dulles airports saw the lowest rates across the country of any major air transportation hub.</p>

                                <p>Honolulu’s Daniel K Inouye International Airport holds the distinction of having the highest rate of runway incursions anywhere in the country. The airport is constrained by the city of Honolulu to the north and east, Mamala Bay to the south, and a naval base to the west. In addition, the airport is a joint-use civil/military airport, serving Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.</p>

                                <p>To accommodate traffic, the airport has two pairs of parallel runways. Runway 8R/22L, colloquially known as “Reef Runway” because of its location on a reef, does not intersect any runway. However, Runway 8L/26R intersects Runways 4L/22R and 4R/22L at a 40-degree angle. Additionally, Runways 4L/22R and 4R/22L are spaced only 350 feet apart, barely enough to accommodate Boeing’s 747-8, which is the longest commercial passenger aircraft in service at 250 feet.</p>

                                <p>Lastly, Taxiways D, E and K cross Runways 8L/26R, 4L/22R, and 4R/22L at non-right angles, further increasing pilot workload in accurately determining position.</p>

                                <p>Boston’s General Edward Lawrence Logan International airport is built atop five islands, Governer’s Island, Apple Island, Noddle’s Island, Hog Island, and Bird’s Island. The airport is surrounded by suburbs on three sides, and water to the east. There are two pairs of parallel runways that intersect at a 110-degree angle, and two crosswind runways. Runway 9/27 intersects Runway 4R/22L at a 50-degree angle, and Runway 14/32 does not intersect any other runway. However, due to proximity to buildings, use of Runway 14/32 is highly restricted depending on crosswind conditions.</p>

                                <p>Like Honolulu’s Inouye airport, non-right angle intersections feature prominently at Logan. Most prominent is the intersection of Runway 15R/33L and Taxiway D, as well as the intersection of Runway 9/27 and Taxiway C. Moreover, the intersection is only 500 feet apart.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Additionally, the thresholds of Runways 4L/22R and 9/27 are in close proximity and are connected by Taxiways K and M. According to the FAA’s From the Flightdeck series, “When runway thresholds are in close proximity, or a connecting taxiway coincides with the intersection of two runways, pilots must be cautious and ensure that they depart the correct runway.”</p>

                                <p>During an incident between a Jetblue Embraer E-190 and a Hop-A-Jet Learjet 60 at Logan in February 2023, the crew of the Learjet failed to ensure proper take-off clearance and took-off from Runway 9, forcing the crew of the Jetblue E-190 – who were landing Runway 4R – to initiate a go-around.</p>

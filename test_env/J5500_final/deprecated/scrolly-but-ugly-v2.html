					<p>In the post-Covid era, a spate of high-profile outbursts aboard airliners unnerved the traveling public, already jittery from the public health mandates necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, a rash of serious runway incursions has further worried travelers, who have to contend with the idea that air travel is becoming less safe than before.</p>

							<p>Runway incursion figures from 2023 seem to reinforce the idea that air travel has been getting less safe. According to <a href=”https://www.cbsnews.com/news/runway-incursions-near-misses-airport-runways-whats-happening/#”>CBS</a>, there have been 571 runway incursion incidents in 2023 to date, from 1,732 in 2022.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="2">
							<p>While it may be tempting to attribute the increased frequency of runway incursions to the lack of flying hours brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, the reality is that runway incursions occurred less frequently in the years following the pandemic than before, pointing to traffic numbers as the top determinant, as suggested by a <a href=”https://tc.canada.ca/sites/default/files/migrated/tp13795e.pdf”>report</a> by Transport Canada.</p>

							<p>Moreover, <a href=”https://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/main.asp”>FAA data</a> suggests that certain airports are more susceptible to runway incursions than other airports. An analysis of the 28 busiest airports in the U.S. revealed that Honolulu, Boston, and Chicago’s Midway airports consistently had the highest rates of runway incursions, while Orlando, Denver, and Washington D.C.’s Dulles airports saw the lowest rates across the country of any major air transportation hub.</p>

						<div class="step" data-step="2">
							<p>The difference in runway incursion rates can be explained by the layout of the runways and taxiways.</p>

							<p>Honolulu’s Daniel K Inouye International Airport holds the distinction of having the highest rate of runway incursions anywhere in the country. The airport is constrained by the city of Honolulu to the north and east, Mamala Bay to the south, and a naval base to the west. In addition, the airport is a joint-use civil/military airport, serving Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="2">
							<p>To accommodate traffic, the airport has two pairs of parallel runways. Runway 8R/22L, colloquially known as “Reef Runway” because of its location on a reef, does not intersect any runway. However, Runway 8L/26R intersects Runways 4L/22R and 4R/22L at a 40-degree angle. Additionally, Runways 4L/22R and 4R/22L are spaced only 350 feet apart, barely enough to accommodate Boeing’s 747-8, which is the longest commercial passenger aircraft in service at 250 feet.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="3">
							<p>Lastly, Taxiways D, E and K cross Runways 8L/26R, 4L/22R, and 4R/22L at non-right angles, further increasing pilot workload in accurately determining position.</p>

							<p>Boston’s General Edward Lawrence Logan International airport is built atop five islands, Governer’s Island, Apple Island, Noddle’s Island, Hog Island, and Bird’s Island. The airport is surrounded by suburbs on three sides, and water to the east. There are two pairs of parallel runways that intersect at a 110-degree angle, and two crosswind runways. Runway 9/27 intersects Runway 4R/22L at a 50-degree angle, and Runway 14/32 does not intersect any other runway. However, due to proximity to buildings, use of Runway 14/32 is highly restricted depending on crosswind conditions.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="2">
							<p>Like Honolulu’s Inouye airport, non-right angle intersections feature prominently at Logan. Most prominent is the intersection of Runway 15R/33L and Taxiway D, as well as the intersection of Runway 9/27 and Taxiway C. Moreover, the intersection is only 500 feet apart.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="3">
							<p>Additionally, the thresholds of Runways 4L/22R and 9/27 are in close proximity and are connected by Taxiways K and M. According to the FAA’s From the Flightdeck series, “When runway thresholds are in close proximity, or a connecting taxiway coincides with the intersection of two runways, pilots must be cautious and ensure that they depart the correct runway.”</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="4">
							<p>During an incident between a Jetblue Embraer E-190 and a Hop-A-Jet Learjet 60 at Logan in February 2023, the crew of the Learjet failed to ensure proper take-off clearance and took-off from Runway 9, forcing the crew of the Jetblue E-190 – who were landing Runway 4R – to initiate a go-around.</p>

							<p>Chicago’s Midway International Airport also features non-right angle intersections. But unlike Honolulu’s Inouye airport and Boston’s Logan airport, the main factor at Midway is the short distances from parking areas to runways and wide expanses of taxiway pavement.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="2">
							<p>Chicago Midway is one of the most unique airports in the U.S. It measures one mile by one mile, and is surrounded by buildings on all sides. The lack of physical space forced planners to orient the runways across the available land area, making taxiways an afterthought.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="3">
							<p>The short distances between non-movement and movement areas often catch pilots unaware, especially when preoccupied completing checklists.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="step" data-step="4">
							<p>Moreover, taxiways at Chicago Midway are often wider than normal to accommodate multiple aircraft wingtip to wingtip. This is necessary because of a lack of dedicated unidirectional taxiways. Wider than normal taxiways may cause a loss of situational awareness when correct visual perception is critical to navigation especially around movement areas.</p>

						<p>A common feature to Inouye, Logan and Midway airports is the lack of physical space to ensure adequate separation between runways, and to enable right-angle intersections. Further analysis of FAA data revealed some commonalities in airfield geometry amongst airports ranked least likely for runway incursions.</p>
		
						<p>Orlando, Denver, and Washington D.C.’s Dulles airports are sprawling complexes, characterized by a central terminal and parking area connected to runways along the periphery by a network of taxiways. More often than not, runways are aligned perpendicular to one another, such as Denver’s three pairs of parallel runways, with Runways 8/26 and 7/25 oriented perpendicular to Runways 16L/34R and 16R/34L, and 17L/35R and 17R/35L.</p>
						
						<p>Likewise, Orlando International Airport has two pairs of parallel runways, 17L/35R and 17R/35L, and 18L/36R and 18R/36L. The benefit to having only parallel runways is a simplified arrival and departure pattern.</p>
						
						<p>Washington D.C.’s Dulles airport has three parallel runways and one crosswind runway. Unlike Inouye, Logan, or Midway, none of them intersect, allowing for greater capacity.</p>

						<p>Disentangling runways goes a long way in simplifying operations and reducing risks that contribute to runway incursions. Nowhere is this more apparent than at Chicago O’Hare airport. In 2005, Chicago officials initiated a 16 year-long $6 billion modernization <a href="https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aerospace/2021-09-13/major-renovation-project-kord-finally-wraps#:~:text=The%20expansive%20project—whose%20final,%2F28L%20(7%2C500%20feet).">program</a> at O’Hare airport. One of the program’s goals was to reduce delays while increasing capacity. To do so, the program called for the decommission of three crosswind runways. However, any positive changes have yet to be reflected in the data.</p>
			
						<p>While O’Hare remains in the middle of the pack for runway incursion risk, it has not been immune to the surge of runway incursions between 2014 and 2018, suggesting that while traffic volume and airfield geometry play a large role in determining the risk of runway incursions, they are insufficient in isolation to explain the rash of incidents since 2022.</p>
			
						<p>If anything, the data suggests that the recent spate of incidents are nothing new. Air travel has not been getting any more or less safe. Rather, it represents a normalization after a turbulent chapter of history.</p>

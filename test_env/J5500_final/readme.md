# Folder directory

### Overview
- There are three folders and three files enclosed within this final project file
- All visual assets needed are located in the 'assets' folder
- The 'assets' folder also contains a .txt file with the embed codes for the charts built using Flourish
- 'Deprecated' contains all previous builds

### Issues encountered
- A limited understanding of Javascript turned out to be the major blocker in the course of this project
- As such, I co-opted Jonathan Soma's "sticky-side" tutorial to build my project upon
- The limits of my knowledge prevented further customization of the visual assets' size, resulting in inconsistent margins
  and padding. Perhaps a deeper understanding of Flexbox would have helped in this regard.
- My limited technical knowledge also prevented me from implementing more advanced interactives, such as playing audio and video
  on scroll event, and zooming in and out of svg images
